# Binary-Search-Trees

I created factories in order to build balanced Binary Search Trees (using JavaScript) with different functions included:

- buildTree function that takes an array of data and turns it into a balanced binary tree full of Node objects appropriately placed.
- insertNode and deleteNode functions that accepts a value to insert/delete.
- find function that accepts a value and returns the node with the given value.
- levelOrder function that accepts a random optional callback function as its parameter. This function traverse the tree in breadth-first level order.
- inorder, preorder and postorder functions that also accept a random optional callback as a parameter. Each of these functions traverse the tree in their respective depth-first order.
- height function that accepts a node and returns its height.
- depth function that accepts a node and returns its depth.
- isBalanced function that checks if the tree is balanced.
- rebalance function that rebalances an unbalanced tree.

A little script is included in order to test these functions.
